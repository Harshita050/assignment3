        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The sweet brand is named after the town of Werther in Westphalia, where the company was founded in 1903. In
          1969, the sweet began marketing under the brand name Werthers Echte. The brand name Werther's Original was
          adopted in the 1990s for the international market.[2] They are now manufactured nearby, in Halle (Westfalen).
        </p>
        <h2>Product</h2>
        <p>The original Werthers Echte was a caramel hard candy. Later variants included chewy toffees, and a soft, waxy
          form which melts easily inside the mouth called "butterscotch-melts." A variant with chocolate filling is also
          available, as well as three sugarless variants that use isomalt as a sugar substitute: the original
          butterscotch flavour, a butterscotch coffee swirl, and a butterscotch mint swirl. A product available in the
          United Kingdom is "Werther's Chocolate," a dark and milk chocolate with butterscotch running through it, sold
          in the same packaging and wrappers as Werther's Originals. A variant available in Canada and the United
          States, "Butterscotch Apple Filled," has a green-apple-flavored filling.</p>
        <h2>Commercials</h2>
        <p>Well-known TV advertisements in Germany and the United Kingdom from the late 1980s featured an older man
          offering Werther's butterscotch to his grandson.The actor Arnold Peters appeared in them.[3] In the United
          States commercials, TV actor Robert Rockwell played the kind-hearted grandfather. The grandson was played by
          Raymond Hewitt.One of these ads[4] was dubbed into Japanese[5] and aired in Japan in the early 2000s. Its
          off-putting voice acting led to it becoming an Internet meme in Japan on sites such as 2channel and Nico Nico
          Douga.[6][better source needed]One British advertisement consisted of a montage of the grandfather and
          grandson bonding together (for example, pointing at animals out of train windows). The lyrics of the song
          which accompanied this ended: "When one who loves you says to you: You're someone very special too."</p>
